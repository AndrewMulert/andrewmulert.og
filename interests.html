                    <p>I've always been intrigued by Google and inspired by how they design their products and services. 
                        Since 2016 I've been watching their developer conferences yearly, and always look forward to hearing the latest announcements they make.
                        They take the time to create updates and products that listen to the people using them, while also creating smart features that improve the quality of the experience they provide.
                        It's been a dream job to one day work for them as a company, and I hope to create designs that are just as innovative as theirs.

                    <p>Ever since I was young, I've always wanted a camera. 
                        <!--Growing up, my Dad was (and still is) taking a ton of photos and I was impressed by the amazing composites he took!
                        And then when I was finally gifted my first camera, I took as many photos of as many things I could find in the backyard.
                        That's how it started, and my hobby for taking photos has continued since then. -->
                        I've owned many cameras over the years, and will stop at any moment I can to take pictures even if I get left behind on group activities just to do so.
                        Even on the days where I'm not carrying my phone, I make sure to always bring a camera with me.
                        There's just something so magical about capturing the world around me, and I take every chance I get to preserve a moment in nature.
                        Most of the photos on this website were taken and edited by me.

                    <p>When I get stressed, one of my favorite activities is to walk around and take photos.
                        <!--Photography is a fun hobby because it allows me to capture the world around me and to practice my skills with photo editing.-->
                        A lot of my photos comprise of nature, buildings, and objects that interest me since it can be fun taking time to notice the small changes in the world around you.
                        But since Social Media can be a toxic environment at times, and photos of buildings can be impersonal, I like to upload most of my photos to Google Maps.
                        I hope that these photos I upload can help the community as they have helped me to explore the world around me.

                    <p>While there are many different art styles and forms of art, one of the kinds I enjoy the most is ink.
                        <!--I love the fluid way the pen makes sharp crisp marks, and the bright colors that can be made with highlighter colors.
                        But the thing that brings this medium together the best for me is graph paper.-->
                        With graph paper, I can design intricate, complex, repeating patterns that connect in interesting ways.
                        Usually, I don't determine on a single design to repeat until I've found a shape or idea that I've iterated multiple times and I come across a fun one.
                        Once that happens, the clipboard is grabbed, and the process ensues for hours.
                        <!--I haven't touched that style of art in a while due to the business of college life, but I hope to return to it soon.-->

                    <p>I enjoy cooking my own meals and making food. While, baking for fun isn't something I do nearly enough, I do enjoy it.
                        Baking foods and cooking cheers others up, and is something that I could do a lot more of.
                        The aroma while something is cooking always makes a place feel more like home.

                        I've also had the chance to learn piano and trumpet, though I'm currently just a member of my congregations' choir.

                    <p>Something that I would like to try more of is creating tech renders. 
                        This is one of the ideas I had a while back of the Windows 11 'Blue Screen of Death' on the dimensions of a phone screen.
                        I designed this in Adobe Illustrator and combined all of the elements in PhotoShop.
                        There will probably be a few more designs to come in the future.

                    <p>Infinity Train is one of my favorite shows due to the good character development through the show, beautiful animation, and emphasis it puts on change.
                        This show has inspired many hours of designing and drawing, and continues to excite me with the unique storytelling and mysteries it presents its audience with.
                        While the show may have been cancelled, I hope for its return to television someday.

                    <p>While it may seem like a generic choice for an interest,
                        Star Wars is an inspiration not just to millions around the world but to me as well. 
                        With the creativity the franchise has instilled about the wonders of the future and the joys of Technology and Science, it has given me excitement.
                        The stories give hope and have helped me to endure hardships instead of giving up, whether that is on a project or just life in general.
                        Star Wars will be something I continue to appreciate, for the enjoyment it has and will continue to give me in the future.

                    <p>Marvel has inspired me in many ways, but one of the most important ways is teaching me that anything is possible. 
                        When making choices, it is important to recognize that there are many types of people in the world.
                        Take the time to recognize the influence you have on the lives of others.
                        Look at yourself, and determine if you are going to choose to help others or not every day of your life.
                        Marvel reminds me that these choices and changes can happen, but ultimately it is up to you to choose to make those actions.
